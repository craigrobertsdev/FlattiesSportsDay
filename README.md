## Description

School sports days are some of the busiest days of the year for teachers, who have to manage their classes as they move through multiple events and keep track of athletic and spirit scores.

This app is designed to simplify the tracking of sports day scores for teachers at McLaren Flat Primary School by providing a centralised platform for them to manage scoring without dealing manually with score cards. This also frees up staff who were previously dedicated to track different spirit scores by allowing anyone the ability to add points as they see fit.

This application has been designed in consultation with the school and is specific to their needs. In this version the app has been made more generic and extensible to have application to other schools with few changes required.

The app leverages the power of ASP.NET Core Blazor Server, Tailwind CSS and uses a SQLite Database. It is hosted in Microsoft Azure's App Service.
